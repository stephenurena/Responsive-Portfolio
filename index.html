              <p>Stephen is a web-development student at the Coding Bootcamp at UC San Diego (yes, I’m speaking in the third-person). He was born and raised in the best city in America (hint hint nudge nudge: San Diego, CA). He tends to get minimal amounts of sleep, because of a full-time job, now school and two energetic boys as shown on the picture, Emiliano- Emi for short (2.5 years, below), and Nicolas, Nico for short (10-months, above). But still finds ways to squeeze time to give them the proper amount of attention, they deserve.</p><br>
              <p>Stephen tends to ask why for many random things, which I guess pointed him to this course. Like why are they (i.e. developers) getting paid decent money? And why most of them don’t have a degree and still getting paid well, contrary to the conventional wisdom? And why can’t I do that? And now, why didn’t I do this sooner?</p><br>
              <p>Stephen has concluded that the question of why catches on very fast from hearing it E-V-E-R-Y S-I-N-G-L-E day from his son Emi (the kid that now asks why for everything). </p><br>
